    <h1>🎓 Graduation Requirements</h1>
<h2>Duration</h2>
<ul>
<li>A PhD thesis <strong>typically takes 3–4 years</strong> to complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<ul>
<li>To graduate, <strong>30 ECTS</strong> are required — see the <strong><a href="https://aaugs-dp-biosciences-and-drug-research.github.io/Curriculum/">Curriculum</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Dissertation Format (Current AAU Regulations)</h2>
<p>An article-based doctoral dissertation typically consists of <strong>2–3 scientific articles</strong>.<br />
A licentiate dissertation must include <strong>at least one article</strong>.<br />
In addition to what is outlined in this procedure, doctoral programmes may provide programme-specific guidelines for article-based dissertations.</p>
<p>The following are considered scientific articles:
- Published articles<br />
- Articles accepted for publication<br />
- Unpublished manuscripts that have undergone peer review or been accepted for publication<br />
- Unpublished manuscripts submitted for peer review  </p>
<h3>Number of Articles</h3>
<p>The articles constitute the main scientific contribution of the dissertation.<br />
The number of articles depends on their <strong>scope</strong>, <strong>scientific significance</strong>, and <strong>quality</strong>, the <strong>publication platform</strong>, and the <strong>author’s individual contribution</strong> in the case of co-authored articles.  </p>
<p>At least <strong>one article must be accepted for publication</strong>.<br />
In exceptional cases, the <strong>Head of Department</strong> may approve the submission of a dissertation with fewer articles than recommended, provided that the scope and quality are sufficiently high.  </p>
<p>Preliminary examiners will pay particular attention to articles that have not yet been accepted for publication.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Doctoral Programme Recommendations</h2>
<p>Within our doctoral programme, we <strong>recommend</strong> the following to emphasize <strong>quality over quantity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>typical thesis consists of two high-quality papers</strong>, with <strong>at least one</strong> paper as a <strong>first-author</strong> publication.  </li>
<li><strong>≥50%</strong> of the included work should be <strong>published</strong> (or accepted).  </li>
<li>The decision to proceed to the <strong>PhD defence</strong> is made by the <strong>supervisor</strong> and the <strong>head of subject</strong>.  </li>
<li>For each manuscript included in the thesis, the <strong>contribution of the PhD researcher must be clearly explained and justified</strong>:</li>
<li>Avoid vague statements.  </li>
<li><strong>List specific figure panels</strong> and contributions (<strong>data generation</strong>, <strong>analysis</strong>, etc.)  </li>
<li>Use a <strong>template signed by the supervisor</strong>.</li>
</ul>
