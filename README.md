- A **typical thesis consists of two high-quality papers**, with **at least one** paper as a **first-author** publication.  
- **≥50%** of the included work should be **published** (or accepted).  
- The decision to proceed to the **PhD defence** is made by the **supervisor** and the **head of subject**.  
- For each manuscript included in the thesis, the **contribution of the PhD researcher must be clearly explained and justified**:
  - Avoid vague statements.  
  - **List specific figure panels** and contributions (**data generation**, **analysis**, etc.)  
  - Use a **template signed by the supervisor**.
